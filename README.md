# L2jOpenSource

Project SVN : https://svn.code.sf.net/p/l2jopensource/projects/ 

 Content :

Here you will find most of the paid and closed source projects for L2 Interlude and H5 with one little twist...

They will be open source!

So you can freely download them, review the source code, use the source code, change the source code and enforce the four essential freedoms on them without any problems. As it should have been from the beginning of time.

That's it. No more, no less.
