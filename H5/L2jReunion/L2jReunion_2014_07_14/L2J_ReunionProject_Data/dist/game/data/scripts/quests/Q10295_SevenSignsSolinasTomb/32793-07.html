<html><body>Elmore-Aden's Saintess Solina:<br>
I am trapped here, a phantom of thoughts from lifetimes ago. But I have learned that the Seven Seals, filled with the blood of our imperial family, are being unearthed. <br>
What's more, Shilen's dark face shows itself. This, friend, is no coincidence. <br>
I am certain that Judith and his group are involved. If you fail to stop them, if you fail to protect the Seven Seals, Shilen will plague our world. <br>
Shilen is a hurricane, an unstoppable merchant of evil, and will bring devastation unlike any the world has ever seen.<br>
