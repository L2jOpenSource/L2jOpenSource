<font color="LEVEL">Defence Ability:</font>
<br>
If this function is enabled, and someone will attack your location (will try to kill your location Crystal), Crystal will automaticaly try to fend off enemy attack, for example crystal is allowed to spawn his defenders such as Inteligent NPC Guards (like powerful mages which are able to use debufs and magic attacks etc) or dangerous creatures (Monsters) Crystal may also try to paralyze attackers for few seconds. Clan leader may enable those defence abilites by adequate price. Remember, even if this ability is enabled - your crystal may be killed easily, crystal may spawn defenders only from time to time, not after each attack!
