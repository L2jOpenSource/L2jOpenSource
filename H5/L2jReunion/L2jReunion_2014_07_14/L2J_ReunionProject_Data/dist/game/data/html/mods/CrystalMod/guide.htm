<font color="LEVEL">General Info:</font>
<br>
Its simple and clear, there are few locations which are conquerable. It means that each clan may be the rightful owner of the individual locations. Each conquerable location has one own Occupation Crystal, each clan is allowed to have multiple locations at once.
<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Become Owner:</font>
<br>
To become lord of the location, you will have to kill Occupation Crystal (don't wory, he will be respawned shortly) and kill its defeners and guards - if exist of course. You don't have to be Clan Leader to conquer location.
