Informations about L2jReunion vote managers.
There are 2 vote reward managers implemented on l2jreunion.
Every user is free to use what he likes or even both vote engines at the same time!
We will leave below some basic information about how vote systems works and how to make them work.

No.1 Individual Vote reward system 

This system can be configurated from IndividualVoteSystem.ini file located at game/config/reunion/votesystems.
On this vote system players have to open the vote panel with .votepanel command and vote on both vote banners
before counter ends. If he succeeded a reward panel appears where he can select between 3 rewards.
Everything is configurable and the only thing you have to do, is to set up the required things in configs.

No.2 .getreward Vote reward system 

This system has nothing to do with the previous one, its a new one and it works in other way.
On this vote system players should first vote on banners and then come ingame and press .getreward.
Then if they had successfully voted they will get automatically rewards.
Everything is configurable and the only thing you have to do, is to set up the required things in configs.

It works with http://l2top.co/ ,so your server should be on their toplists.
This system actually will only check l2top.co votes so you should trap your voters to vote on all banners.
One way of doing this is to put l2top.con banner on the latest positions.

Non will know which banner we check to figure out if he voted...
