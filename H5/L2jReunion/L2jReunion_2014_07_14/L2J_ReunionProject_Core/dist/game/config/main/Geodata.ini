# GeoData options:
# 0 = GeoData and PathFinding OFF (default)
# 1 = GeoData is used to check Line Of Sight (LOS) targeting and 
#     L2Playable movement. You need to download files for data/geodata folder.
#     Monsters can pass walls but not aggro (no line of sight) through them.
# 2 = Full GeoData enabled. Includes PathFinding (requires also /data/pathnode 
#     files if CellPathFinding not enabled) and all character moves go through 
#     geodata checks (if a mob passes a wall, pathfinding didn't find a route 
#     but we allow attack and returning home).
#     Recommended server memory minimum 2 GB, rather 3 GB.
# Default: 0

# Default: com.l2jserver.gameserver.geoengine.NullDriver

# This setting controls Client <--> Server Player coordinates synchronization:
# -1 - Will synchronize only Z from Client --> Server. Default when no geodata.
# 1 - Synchronization Client --> Server only. Using this option (without geodata) makes it more difficult for players to bypass obstacles.
# 2 - Intended for geodata (at least with cell-level pathfinding, otherwise can you try -1).
# Server sends validation packet if client goes too far from server calculated coordinates.
