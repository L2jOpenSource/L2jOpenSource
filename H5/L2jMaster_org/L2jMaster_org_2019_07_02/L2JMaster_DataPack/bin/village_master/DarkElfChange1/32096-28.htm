<html><body>Grand Master Helminter:<br>
Regardless of your occupation, you must reach at least level 20 before you can obtain the right to transfer to another class. Likewise, in order to become a Dark Wizard, you must be at least level 20, and you need proof that you have passed the test to become a Dark Wizard.<br>
Your level is sufficient, but it seems that you have not yet passed the test to become a Dark Wizard. In order to become a Dark Wizard, you must go to <font color="LEVEL">Witch Varika</font> at The Altar of Rites. You must pass the test of a Dark Wizard that she gives and bring back the proof <font color="LEVEL">Jewel of Darkness</font> in order to become a Dark Wizard.
