The red dot indicates the current location of the designated target. The yellow dot indicates the location of the target assigned by an NPC. If the target is out of range, as shown in the picture, it will be displayed on the edge of the radar.<br>
The letters N,S,E,W on the radar indicate north, south, east and west respectively. When a character changes direction the radar turns accordingly. The direction the character is facing will always be aligned with the top of the radar.<br>
