[Human Mystic Class Transfer]:<br>
A Human Mystic who has reached level 20 can change their class to a Wizard or a Cleric. A character may undertake the class transfer quest at level 18; if successful, they will be able to use more specialized and powerful skills than before. In order to become a <font color="LEVEL">Wizard</font>, you must first meet <font color="LEVEL">Parina</font>, and in order to become a <font color="LEVEL">Cleric</font>, you must first meet <font color="LEVEL">Priest Zigaunt</font>. They can both be found in <font color="LEVEL">Gludin Village</font>. Think carefully about which class you want to select, then seek out the appropriate NPC.<br>
