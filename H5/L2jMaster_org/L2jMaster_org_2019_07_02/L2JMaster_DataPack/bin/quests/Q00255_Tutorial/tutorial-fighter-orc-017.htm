Congratulations! You have finally reached level 5.<br>
Now you can learn a new skill. To do so, please visit the <font color="LEVEL">Prefect in the village.</font> If you follow the arrow above your head, you will be able to find the Prefect.<br>
In order to learn a skill, a certain number of <font color="LEVEL">Skill Points (SP)</font> is required. Your SP will increase gradually every time you kill a monster, so if you run out of SP while learning skills, you can always earn more by hunting monsters.<br>
To check your current SP amount, open the <font color="LEVEL">Character Info Window</font> by clicking on the <font color="FF0000">face-shaped icon</font> on the bottom right screen or pressing ALT+&.<br>
