Only those who have already experienced dreams may enter the Rim Kamaloka. The dream of which I speak is that of the Darkness that seeks to destroy.<br>
If you have had that dream, a trace of it -- the "Piece of Dream" -- will have been left on your soul. Based on that trace, we can guide adventurers to the Rim Kamaloka.<br>
However...I sense no such trace in you...<br>
(You may only enter the Rim Kamaloka from a PC Cafe.)
