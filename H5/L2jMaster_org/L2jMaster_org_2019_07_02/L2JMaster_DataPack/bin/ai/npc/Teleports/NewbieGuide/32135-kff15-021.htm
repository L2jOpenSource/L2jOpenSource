Have you considered the next weapon you wish to purchase? Broadswords are mere children's toys to you now. At level 12 or 13, the <font color="LEVEL">Gladius</font> is an excellent choice for a Sword, the <font color="LEVEL">Dirk</font> for a Dagger and the <font color="LEVEL">Dwarven Mace</font> for a Blunt Weapon. Of course, it's too expensive to buy at the shop, but you should be able to obtain a much better price by dealing with other adventurers.<br>
You can also use the <font color="LEVEL">Short Spear</font> of a Polearm type at this level. Polearms are very slow to wield, but they allow you to attack several enemies at once. However, if you switch from your current weapon type to a Polearm, expect some loss of combat effectiveness until you master the new weapon type.<br>
