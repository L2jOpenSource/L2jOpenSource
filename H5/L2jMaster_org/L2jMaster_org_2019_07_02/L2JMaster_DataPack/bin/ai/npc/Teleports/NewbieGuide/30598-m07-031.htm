When you target a monster, the monster's name appears in the upper central portion of the screen.  <font color="LEVEL">The color of the name tells you the monster's difficulty</font>. Those that appear in white or sky blue have abilities equal to or less than yours, while those that appear in red or yellow are stronger than you. Up until level 4 a Mystic can defeat most yellow monsters. After that level, stick to blue or white prey.<br>
