For someone of your level, the following monsters should be adequate targets: <font color="LEVEL">Kasha Timber Wolf, Goblin Tomb Raider or Rakeclaw Imp</font>. Once you pass level 11, try hunting <font color="LEVEL">Werewolves and Darkwing Bats</font> as well.<br>
You can encounter Kasha Timber Wolves by following the northern road to its end and then taking the southwest road at the first three-way crossroads. If you leave the city by the southern road, you will find them near the three-way crossroads. If it's not too crowded, try the southern way first.<br>
You will meet Goblins if you follow the northern road from the northern three-way crossroads or if you travel along the southern road, then head southwest where the sloping road ends. If you follow the road and keep heading east, you will meet Imps. Though you have been fighting each of these monsters since level 6 or so, their leaders will give you a decent fight. <br>
If you're really feeling adventurous, take the road that leads out from the northern gate and head east.<a action="bypass -h Quest NewbieGuide 30602-m14.htm"><br>
