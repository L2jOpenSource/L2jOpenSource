Learning magic is an ongoing process. As you practice what you've learned, you will continue to advance and earn SP. So, if you learn Wind Strike now, you will be able to cast Wind Strike level 2. Then, once you've earned 240 SP, you may use it to learn Wind Strike again, and thus be able to cast Wind Strike level 3.<br>
You can raise your level for almost every skill, so you can decide to either focus all your SP on one skill and become a specialist, or spread out your SP among several different skills.<br>
Finally, in order to learn a magic skill initially, you will need a Spellbook, which you can purchase at the town stores.<br>
