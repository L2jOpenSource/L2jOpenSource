Weapons are classified into seven categories. They are: one-handed swords, blunt weapons, two-handed swords and two-handed blunt weapons, daggers, polearms, fists and bows. Your staff is considered a blunt weapon. I can offer you guidance about swords, blunt weapons, daggers and bows, for they are the most common types around here.<br>
