<html><body>Newbie Guide:<br>
If you are looking for suitable monsters to fight at this level, seek out <font color="LEVEL">Green Goblins or Mountain Werewolves</font>. When you are more comfortable hunting monsters, you may also test yourself against a <font color="LEVEL">Muertos Archer</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Mountain Fungus</font>.<br>
To hunt any of these monsters, take the road leading south from this village to the center of the island and go to a place called the <font color="LEVEL">Hills of Gold</font>. There you will find all the monsters that I spoke of. Before you hunt the Green Goblins, Mountain Werewolves or Muertos Archers, though, visit <font color="LEVEL">Zerstorer Marcela, the Village Captain</font>. She will reward you for defeating a monster of the Hills of Gold.<br>
By the way, be careful of the Muertos wandering around the Hills of Gold. At first glance, you may think a Muertos Archer is an easy target -- take my word for it, they most certainly are not. Wait until you reach at least Level 11 before you try your luck against them! <br>
