When you reach Level 7, you will learn new magic. Seek instruction from the <font color="LEVEL">Magisters</font> of the Shilen Temple. The Shilen Temple is the largest building in the village, located on the north side.<br>
You have probably noticed by now that when you defeat monsters you gain <font color="LEVEL">SP</font> and experience. SP means "skill points," and they are deducted whenever you learn new skills or magic. You can check your current SP by clicking on the <font color="LEVEL">Character Status</font> button, then on the <font color="LEVEL">Status</font> tab.<br>
