<br>Oh, you have a kind heart!
<br>I'll start you with a summoning scroll and some Sedative Potion, and I'll have more for you <font color="LEVEL">every 12 hours</font>. 
When you get out there, use the scroll to summon a beast from another dimension. Don't worry, we've worked out most of the kinks--they almost 
always call a White Tiger Cub these days. Use the sedative to put them to sleep, but try to do it without the White Tiger Matriarch knowing, 
because she gets kind of cranky. I find being in a group is the best way to do it. <font color="LEVEL">One thing to remember</font> is that the 
cubs can be easily scared away.<br>
Once you subdue them, collect their Apiga, and bring it to us.<br>
Oh, and if you happen to run into adult White Tigers, they have Golden Apiga, and we'll pay extra for that.<br>
Oh, and get us those Apigas in record time, and we'll pay double. Not a bad way to make a living, eh?<br><br><br>
