They're strange magical tokens that each tiger carries. We don't really understand it, but we do know that a tiger will be docile to whomever 
holds its Apiga.<br>
The tiger can go back to its own dimension, but once we have the Apigas, we can summon that particular tiger whenever we want, and study 
its particular magical signature.
