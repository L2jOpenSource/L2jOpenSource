First, consider your goal. It should be the central axis around which your life as an adventurer revolves -- a way of life, not simply a destination. We live in an ability-oriented world where the powerful can control entire continents, regardless of their race or class. Ah, and what strange fate is it that the Kamael, the fabled 6th race of mankind, have now emerged from their long hiding. Some say that the Kamael are saviors; others that they will be mankind's doom. <br>
Who knows? In my opinion, the Kamael's combat skill and independence are great strengths. <br>
To achieve their full potential, though, they must train continuously. First, catch <font color="LEVEL">Grey Elpy</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Keltir</font> around the town. Then catch monsters and equip youself with items taken from them, such as weapons and armor. If you do not need the items, sell them at the shop. <br>
