Without a class change,  there is nothing more that you can be taught beyond a certain point. Once you reach level 20, you can change your class.<br>
If I advise you in advance, you can also learn the special skills only available to our race. If you prefer to use a thin blade, you can acquire skills like <font color="LEVEL">Rapier Mastery</font>, which increases your attack power; <font color="LEVEL">Penetrate Shot</font>, which damages an opponent by adding soul power to a bow attack; or <font color="LEVEL">Fire Trap</font>, which explodes when an enemy comes near. <br>
Interested? Then continue your training and prepare to transfer your occupation and you will get what you want. <br>
