You have already accomplished during your short career!<br>
We Newbie Guides are here to help you advance even further. We will assign you several missions to give you valuable experience. Follow our instructions faithfully and you will also be rewarded. We can help only those who wish it. Ultimately, you are responsible for your own success!<br>
After swapping the Weapon Exchange Ticket you received previously with the Non-Grade Shadow Weapon, go visit <font color="LEVEL">Zerstorer Marcela</font> at the <font color="LEVEL">North Gate of Kamael Village</font> and return once you have defeated the monsters on the Golden Hill. To find <font color="LEVEL">Zerstorer Marcela</font>, follow the <font color="LEVEL">arrow</font> above your head. I will tell you more later.<br>
