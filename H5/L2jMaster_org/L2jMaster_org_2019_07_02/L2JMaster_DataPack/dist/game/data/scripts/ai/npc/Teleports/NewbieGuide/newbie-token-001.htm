<html><body>Newbie Guide:<br>
Newbie Guides offer teleportation between Newbie Towns to any character below level 20.<br>
If you use this service, it is also possible to visit the starting village of another race through a <font color="LEVEL">Newbie Guide</font>.<br>
But be careful how you use this advantage -- it is normal to learn a specific skill or perform a specific quest at the designated town of each race.
