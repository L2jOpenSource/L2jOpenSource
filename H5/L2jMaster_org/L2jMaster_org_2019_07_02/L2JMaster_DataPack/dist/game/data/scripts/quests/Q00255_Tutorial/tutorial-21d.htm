[Orc Fighter Class Transfer]:<br>
An Orc Fighter who has reached level 20 may change their class to an Orc Raider or an Orc Monk. A character may undertake the class transfer quest at level 18; if successful, they will be able to use more specialized and powerful skills than before. In order to become an <font color="LEVEL">Orc Raider</font>, you must first meet <font color="LEVEL">Prefect Karukia</font>, and in order to become an <font color="LEVEL">Orc Monk</font>, you must first meet <font color="LEVEL">Gantaki Zu Urutu</font>. They can both be found in the <font color="LEVEL">Orc Village</font>. Think carefully about which class you want to select, then seek out the appropriate NPC.<br>
