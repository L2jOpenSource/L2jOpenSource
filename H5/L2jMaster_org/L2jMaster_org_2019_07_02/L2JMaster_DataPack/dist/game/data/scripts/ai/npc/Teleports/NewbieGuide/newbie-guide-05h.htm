You are making excellent progress!<br>
Continue to follow my advice and carry out the missions I give you, and soon you will be ready to venture into the wider world in search of adventure.<br>
Now go to <font color="LEVEL">Hierarch Kekropus</font> at the <font color="LEVEL">House of the Elders</font>. To find him, just follow the <font color="LEVEL">arrow</font> above your head. When you have completed the task he gives you, come see me for your next mission.<br>
Before you go, is there anything else I can do for you?<br>
