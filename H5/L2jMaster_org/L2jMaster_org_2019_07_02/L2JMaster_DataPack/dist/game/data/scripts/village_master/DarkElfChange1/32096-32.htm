Anyone wishing to become a Shillien Oracle must have achieved at least level 20 and passed the appropriate test.<br>
Your level is satisfactory, but you haven't passed the test. Speak with <font color="LEVEL">Magister Sidra</font> of the Dark Elf Guild in the <font color="LEVEL">Town of Gludio</font>. Pass her test, and bring me the <font color="LEVEL">Jewel of Darkness</font> as proof.
