[Elven Mage Occupation Change]:<br>
An Elven Mage who has reached level 20 may transfer their class to an Elven Wizard or Oracle. A character who completes this class transfer can use even more specialized and powerful skills than before, so consider undertaking the class transfer quest when you reach level 18. To become an <font color="LEVEL">Elven Wizard</font>, speak with <font color="LEVEL">Rosella</font>; to become an <font color="LEVEL">Oracle</font>, speak with <font color="LEVEL">Priest Manuel</font>. They can be found in the <font color="LEVEL">Elven Village</font> and the <font color="LEVEL">Town of Gludio</font>, respectively. Think carefully about which class to select, then go seek out the appropriate NPC.<br>
