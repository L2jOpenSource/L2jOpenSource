<html><body>Grand Master Helminter:<br>
Regardless of your occupation, you must reach at least level 20 before you can obtain the right to transfer to another class. Likewise, in order to become a Dark Wizard, you must be at least level 20 or higher, and you must also possess proof showing that you passed the test of a Dark Wizard.<br>
I am afraid that you are unqualified for several reasons. First of all, you must devote all of your efforts in attaining level 20. Then, you must undertake the test of a Dark Wizard and obtain proof called <font color="LEVEL">Jewel of Darkness</font> and bring it back to me. You can take the test of a Dark Wizard from <font color="LEVEL">Witch Varika</font>, who lives in the Dark Forest. You will find her praying at the <font color="LEVEL">Altar of Rites</font> in the southern part of the Dark Forest.
