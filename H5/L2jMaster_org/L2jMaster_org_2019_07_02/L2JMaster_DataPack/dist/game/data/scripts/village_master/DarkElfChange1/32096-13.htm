<html><body>Grand Master Helminter:<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Shillien Oracles</font> derive their awesome powers of death, destruction and chaos from their studious observance of Gran Kain and Shilen. Unlike Humans or Elven Priests, who merely follow the gods of light, the Shillien Oracles analyze the intricacies of the relationship between light and darkness. They are therefore able to use White and Support Magic to protect and heal their comrades, while attacking their enemies with devastating Dark Magic attacks.<br>
Only the most elite of Shillien Oracles are chosen to be <font color="LEVEL">Shillien Elders</font>, who will continue their studies into the highest levels of magic. They are important spiritual leaders with a deep understanding of the divinity of Gran Kain and Shilen.<br>
Those who wish to become Shillien Oracles must pass the appropriate test and bring me the <font color="LEVEL">Orb of Abyss</font>.<br>
