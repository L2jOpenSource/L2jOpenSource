The magicians of our race have many choices when it comes to using magic. Trial and error will probably be your best teacher, but let me give you a few pointers:<br>
First, learn <font color="LEVEL">Dreaming Spirit</font> before reaching level 14. Not only will your chances of dying decrease tremendously, but hunting will also become easier. Then learn <font color="LEVEL">Weapon Mastery</font>. <br>
You must also pay attention to defense-related passive skills. Check the type of armor you are wearing right now and think about whether you want to focus on defense or magic from now on. If you learn Robe Mastery and choose to stay with the Robe type, you will be able to quickly use many types of magic, but your defensive power will decrease. If you learn Light Armor Mastery and choose to stay with the Light Armor type, you will gain defensive power but your MP amount and magic speed will decrease.<br>
When you reach level 14, you will be able to learn more skills. If you want to rely more on physical attacks, raise <font color="LEVEL">Soul Cry</font> to level 2; if you want to rely more on magic, learn <font color="LEVEL">Chant of Battle</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Fear</font> and go hunting with your party.<br>
When hunting on your own, an indirect magic attack like <font color="LEVEL">Chill Flame</font> is also useful.<a action="bypass -h Quest NewbieGuide 30602-m14.htm"><br>
