<html><body>Newbie Guide:<br>
You must journey to the Kingdom of Aden to assume your new profession. You can obtain training in <font color="LEVEL">Gludin Village</font> or <font color="LEVEL">the Town of Gludio</font>. There is nothing more for you to learn here, in the land of your birth.<br>
You can reach the Town of Gludio faster by asking the Gatekeeper to teleport you there. Obviously you will have to pay for that service, but doing so will save you a lot of time. If you prefer not to spend your money, you can reach Oren by swimming and then walk to the town... I do not recommend that, however -- it is both dangerous and time-consuming.<br>
