Very well. Travelling alone is not always easy, but it has its own rewards. But if you really want to live and hunt alone, you should know a few things first.<br>
Timing is important for hunting. To progress at the best rate, you must reduce the time between battles to a minimum. Defeating a powerful enemy for a single great experience reward is often less valuable than defeating a whole series of lesser enemies in the same span of time.
