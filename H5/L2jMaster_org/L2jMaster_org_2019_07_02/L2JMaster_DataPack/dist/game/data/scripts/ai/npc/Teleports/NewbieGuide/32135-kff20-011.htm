As you may know, Kamael gender has a dramatic impact on both magical power and physical attributes. As a result, male Kamael may become <font color="LEVEL">Troopers</font>, while females are only eligible to become <font color="LEVEL">Warders</font>. <br>
Don't be too disappointed with that, though -- the Kamael may have fewer options regarding occupations, but their power is arguably stronger. <br>
For more information about certain classes and class transfers, speak with <font color="LEVEL">Vice Hierarch Zenya</font> at the <font color="LEVEL">Hierarch's House</font>. If you leave the island, you can find a Grand Master in every village. You can complete your first class transfer in Gludin Village, Gludio Village, Dion Village or Schuttgart Village.<br>
