<html><body>Newbie Guide:<br>
It's time for you to learn about other items. I'm sure that by now you've used a lesser healing Potion, but there's a lot more that you need to know about it if you plan to succeed.<br>
First, let's talk about <font color="LEVEL">Accessories</font>. Basically, Accessories raise your magical defense power. <font color="LEVEL">Colossus</font> should be the first monster you will see. Unless you raise your magical defense power enough, you will have difficulty defeating it in combat. So you'd best raise your magical defense power, eh?<br>
Next, let's talk about a <font color="LEVEL">Scroll of Escape</font>. Using it instantly transports you to the nearest village. If your favorite hunting ground is far from the village, a Scroll of Escape can save you a long walk. But be aware that it takes long time to cast the magic, and using it for that purpose may not be cost efficient. I know, though, that you newbies are always eager to try your hand at any magic that comes your way! <br>
