<html><body>Grand Master Helminter:<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Assassins</font> specialize in concealment, ambush, and espionage. They favor small, simple weapons like Daggers, which are quick and easily concealed. They're capable of inflicting fatal damage on their enemies' weak points and are vicious with the Bow. Assassins are as vital as Palus Knights in battle, and their skill in total darkness is unparalleled.<br>
Assassins can become <font color="LEVEL">Abyss Walkers</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Phantom Rangers</font>. Abyss Walkers continue their studies in assassination and espionage, and Phantom Rangers further develop their archery skills.<br>
Anyone wishing to advance to this class must have achieved at least level 20 and proven themselves by bringing me the <font color="LEVEL">Iron Heart</font>.<br>
