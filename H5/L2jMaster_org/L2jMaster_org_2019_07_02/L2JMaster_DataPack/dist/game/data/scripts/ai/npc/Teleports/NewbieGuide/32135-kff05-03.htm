First, catch <font color="LEVEL">Grey Keltir</font> or the <font color="LEVEL">Dominant Grey Keltir</font> in the less dangerous areas of town. After you have acquired some experience, try to catch the <font color="LEVEL">Black Wolf</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Dominant Black Wolf</font>. Be cautious: the wolves in this area may be too strong for you right now! <br>
Here's a tip so for determining the power and skill of a monster: when you target the monster, you will see its name in the upper-central part of the screen; <font color="LEVEL">the color of the monster's name signifies its strength. </font> Attack only white or light blue monsters in the beginning. Yellow and red monsters are stronger than you are, so do not attack them carelessly.<br>
