Congratulations! You've finally reached level 7.<br>
You are now eligible to learn new magic as well as further enhance existing magic. To do so, seek out the <font color="LEVEL">Magister in the village</font>. You can find the Magister by following the direction indicated by the arrow above your head.<br>
Learning a skill requires a certain number of <font color="LEVEL">Skill Points (SP)</font>. SP is gradually accumulated through hunting monsters. If you don't have enough SP to learn a skill, acquire more by spending time hunting!<br>
To see how many SP you currently have, open the <font color="LEVEL">Character Info Screen</font> by clicking on the <font color="FF0000">face icon</font> at the bottom right of your screen (you can also press ALT+T).<br>
