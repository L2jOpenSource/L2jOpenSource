Upper and lower body armor are classified as either <font color="LEVEL">Robes</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Light Gear</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Heavy Gear</font>. Kamael use Light Gear.<br>
When you transfer your profession at level 20, the armor you wear will influence your choice of skills. For example, Light Armor Mastery is a skill which increases defense power and evasion.<br>
But you are only considered to be equipped with a given type of armor <font color="LEVEL">if both your upper and lower body is equipped with the same armor type</font>. In other word, the Light Armor Mastery works only when you wear Light Gear on both your upper and lower body. <br>
Your helmet, gloves and other gear do not affect it, so wear what you wish. <br>
