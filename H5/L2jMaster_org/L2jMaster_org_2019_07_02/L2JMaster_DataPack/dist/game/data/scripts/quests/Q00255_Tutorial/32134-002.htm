Did you forget your mission? You must <font color="LEVEL">defeat the Gremlins and recover the Blue Gem they stole</font>.<br>
To target a Gremlin for attack, simply move your cursor on top of it and click <font color="FF0000">the left mouse button</font>. The cursor will change into the shape of a knife; when that happens, click the left mouse button again to begin attacking. <img src="L2UI_CH3.tutorial_img12" width=64 height=64> <br>
If you successfully return the Blue Gem to me, I will give you reward!
