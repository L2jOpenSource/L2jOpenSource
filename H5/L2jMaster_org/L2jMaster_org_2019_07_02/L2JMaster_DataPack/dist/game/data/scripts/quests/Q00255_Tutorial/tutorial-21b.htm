[Elven Fighter Class Transfer]:<br>
An Elven Fighter who has reached level 20 may change their class to an Elven Knight or an Elven Scout. A character may undertake the class transfer quest at level 18; if successful, they will be able to use more specialized and powerful skills than before. In order to become an <font color="LEVEL">Elven Knight</font>, you must first meet <font color="LEVEL">Master Sorius</font>, and in order to become an <font color="LEVEL">Elven Scout</font>, you must first meet <font color="LEVEL">Master Reisa</font>. They can both be found in the <font color="LEVEL">Town of Gludio</font>. Think carefully about which class you want to select, then seek out the appropriate NPC.<br>
