What kind of attack skill are you using right now? My advice is that you choose one skill and focus exclusively on mastering it.<br>
After learning general attack skills, you will learn <font color="LEVEL">Relax</font>, which is a recovery skill, and <font color="LEVEL">Weapon Mastery</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Armor Mastery</font>, which are passive skills. If you want my preference, I think that it is better to learn Weapon Mastery than Armor Mastery. That's just my opinion, mind you.<br>
Once you reach level 10, you can start upgrading your skills to a higher level. It is important that you master the skill that you think is most critical for your success.<br>
If you choose archery, you'll have the opportunity to hunt some very unique creatures, but developing the skill costs both money and MP. To my thinking, it's not really a suitable weapon for us Orcs . . .<br>
